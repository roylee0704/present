# Government Meeting Management Mobile Application Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
Based on your brief, here are the key desired outcomes:

• **Eliminate Paper-Based Meeting Workflow:** Replace 5-7 day manual process with same-day digital approval and notification system
• **Streamline Government Meeting Approval:** Enable digital Mayor approval with signature capture reducing approval time to <4 hours
• **Optimize Tablet-Based Document Access:** Provide superior PDF/Word/Excel viewing for council members during actual meetings
• **Achieve High User Adoption:** Reach 95% adoption rate among government officials within 3 months of launch
• **Ensure Government Compliance:** Meet Thai National ID authentication and digital signature legal requirements
• **Reduce Administrative Overhead:** Decrease admin coordination time by 80% through automated digital workflows

### Background Context

The Thai municipal government currently operates with an entirely manual, paper-based meeting management process that creates significant inefficiencies. Meeting preparation requires 5-7 days minimum due to physical document delivery, manual mayoral signatures, postal distribution to council members, and phone confirmations. This results in substantial administrative costs, environmental waste, and delayed government responsiveness.

This PRD addresses the urgent need for government digitization by creating a Flutter tablet application that transforms the complete workflow from meeting creation to attendance tracking. The solution specifically targets the government approval hierarchy (Admin → Mayor → Council Members) while maintaining legal compliance for digital signatures and providing tablet-optimized document viewing during actual meetings.
