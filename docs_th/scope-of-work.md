**Right-Sized Architecture for Small User Base (50-60 users):**
```
Over-Engineered Alternatives:
✗ Redis caching unnecessary for 50-60 concurrent users
✗ Multi-AZ deployments excessive for small government office
✗ Auto-scaling groups not needed for predictable load
✗ Complex microservices architecture adds unnecessary complexity

Optimized AWS Stack:
✅ Single RDS instance handles 50-60 users efficiently
✅ Simple session management via database
✅ Cost-effective infrastructure sizing
✅ Government compliance maintained without over-provisioning
✅ Easy to scale up if user base grows significantly
```
