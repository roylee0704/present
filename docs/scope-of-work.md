## Risk Management

### Key Risks & Mitigation Strategies

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Council member tablet availability** | HIGH | MEDIUM | Conduct device survey in Week 0; budget for tablet procurement if needed |
| **Supabase 200GB egress limit exceeded** | MEDIUM | LOW | 500MB/user cache limit + WiFi-preferred downloads; monitor usage in production |
| **Thai National ID validation requirements unclear** | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Clarify requirements in Week 1 technical discovery; implement format validation as baseline |
| **Document viewing performance on older tablets** | MEDIUM | LOW | Test on minimum spec devices (iPad 5th gen, Android 8.0 tablets) in Week 6 |
| **User adoption resistance (paper preference)** | HIGH | MEDIUM | Superior tablet UX + training + quick wins (instant access vs postal delays) |
| **Admin panel integration complexity** | LOW | LOW | Standalone admin panel requires no legacy integration |
| **Timeline delay due to scope creep** | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Strict adherence to MVP scope; defer all Phase 2 requests |

### Assumptions

**Critical Assumptions:**
- Council members have access to compatible tablets (iOS 14+ or Android 8.0+)
- Average meeting document size <50MB per file
- 20-30 council members (50-60 total users including admins)
- 5-15 meetings per month requiring coordination
- Internet connectivity available for initial document download (WiFi or cellular)
- Meeting venues may lack reliable internet (hence offline requirement)
- Government accepts admin approval workflow (no mayor approval stage)
- Thai National ID format validation sufficient (no government API integration)

**Technical Assumptions:**
- Supabase Pro sufficient for 50-60 concurrent users
- 200GB/month Supabase egress sufficient with caching strategy
- Firebase FCM free tier adequate for notification volume
- No custom government authentication system integration required
- Standard SSL certificates acceptable (no government PKI requirement)
